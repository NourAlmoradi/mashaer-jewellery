## 1. Executive Summary (The Core Idea)

**Hekaya Jewellery** is a premium, bilingual (Arabic & English) e-commerce platform specializing in **children's fine Jewellery**.

While traditional Jewellery is valued purely for its material, Hekaya introduces a profound emotional layer: **The Dynamic QR Memory System**. Every piece of kids' Jewellery sold comes with a unique, dynamic QR code. When scanned, this code unlocks a private, parent-managed digital memory page dedicated to the child wearing the piece.

Hekaya transforms a simple piece of gold into a living, digital heirloom that captures a child's precious photos and heartfelt messages.

## 2. The Problem & The Solution

### The Market Problem

When parents or grandparents buy Jewellery for children, the pieces are often outgrown, stored away, or passed down with the memories surrounding them forgotten. A gold bracelet bought for a 1st birthday is just a bracelet ten years later; the emotional context of _when_ and _why_ it was given is lost to time.

### The Hekaya Solution

We digitize the emotional value of the Jewellery. By tying a physical, high-quality piece of Jewellery to a secure digital memory timeline, we ensure that the story outlives the moment. The Jewellery becomes a physical key to a digital vault of childhood memories.

## 3. The Star Feature: Dynamic QR Memory System

This is the original, innovative idea that sets Hekaya apart from any other Jewellery brand in the market.

**How it works (The User Journey):**

1. **The Purchase:** A customer (parent, grandparent, friend) buys a piece of kids' Jewellery from the website.
2. **The Generation:** The system automatically generates a unique, beautiful Warm Gold QR code tied specifically to that order.
3. **The Setup:** The parent receives the Jewellery, scans the QR code with their phone, and is guided to upload up to 3 photos and write a heartfelt title and message.
4. **The Memory:** The parent creates a beautiful, PIN-protected memory page that anyone with the 4-digit PIN can view by scanning the QR code.
5. **The Heirloom:** The memory page is editable anytime — the parent can update photos and messages as the child grows.

**Privacy & Security:**
All memory pages are **PIN-protected** — a 4-digit code is required to view the content. Only the owner (logged in) can edit the memory.

## 4. Brand Identity & Aesthetic

- **Design Philosophy:** "Quiet Luxury" (الفخامة الهادئة). We avoid the loud, bubbly, "candy-like" aesthetics typical of children's brands. Instead, the design is elegant, refined, and professional—respecting that parents are the buyers.
- **Colors:** Warm Gold (`#C9A96E`) representing luxury and heritage, paired with Charcoal Black (`#1A1A1A`) and Warm White (`#FAFAF8`) for breathing room and high contrast.
- **Typography:** Elegant serif fonts (Cormorant Garamond / Amiri) for headings to evoke a heritage feel, paired with clean sans-serif (Inter / Noto Sans Arabic) for modern readability.
- **Tone of Voice:** Emotional, authentic, and high-end.

## 5. Target Audience & Market Focus

**Primary Market:** The UAE and GCC region.
**Languages:** 100% Bilingual from Day 1. Users can seamlessly switch between Arabic (RTL) and English (LTR).

**Target Customers:**

1. **New Mothers:** Looking for meaningful keepsakes for their babies.
2. **Grandparents/Relatives:** Looking for a unique, high-value gift that stands out from standard toys or clothes.
3. **Fathers:** Looking for a memorable gift for their wives/daughters on special occasions (births, birthdays, Eid).

## 6. Technical Architecture (The Engine)

The platform is built on a modern, enterprise-grade, yet cost-effective tech stack ensuring maximum speed, security, and scalability.

- **Frontend framework:** Next.js 15.5 (React) — extremely fast, SEO optimized.
- **i18n:** Custom bilingual AR/EN system using Zustand locale store + `src/lib/i18n.ts`. Full RTL/LTR support. No third-party i18n library.
- **Current MVP data layer:** All data (cart, orders, memories) persisted client-side via Zustand + localStorage. No backend required for the MVP.
- **Production backend (planned):** Supabase (PostgreSQL) — secure, real-time database with Row Level Security (RLS) to protect user data and memories.
- **Payments (planned):** Apple Pay, Mastercard, and PayPal — processing securely via Stripe and PayPal integrations. Prices will be strictly calculated on the server to prevent hacking. Current MVP mocks payment success.
- **Hosting:** Vercel — providing global edge-network speeds (fast loading in the UAE) and free automatic SSL.
- **Cost Strategy:** Designed to launch at **~$12/year** (domain cost only) by utilizing generous free tiers of the best developer tools. The business only pays when it scales and generates high revenue.

## 7. Platform Structure (Simplified UI/UX)

The website is designed to be highly intuitive, avoiding the complexity of massive e-commerce sites.

- **Homepage:** 7 clean sections (Hero Image, Brand Story, Featured Collections, Memory Feature Explanation, Testimonials, Footer). No clutter.
- **Product Pages:** High-quality imagery, clear pricing, and a prominent badge indicating "Includes QR Memory."
- **Shopping Flow:** Slide-out cart, simple 3-step checkout (Shipping → Review → Payment).
- **User Dashboard:** Customers can track orders, manage addresses, and access their "My Memories" portal to edit their children's timelines.
- **Admin Dashboard:** A private area for the store owner and store manager to add products and view/update orders.
