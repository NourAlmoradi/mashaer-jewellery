## 📦 Latest Frontend Iteration (parity additions)

The following gaps with the design reference were closed in this iteration. All routes still build to static HTML and the production `npm run build` passes (25 routes prerendered).

- [x] Final CTA band on the Home page ("Ready to Create a Memory?")
- [x] Footer WhatsApp icon, wired to `adminSettings.store.whatsapp`
- [x] Product card category eyebrow tag
- [x] PDP category eyebrow + age + material chips (new `Product.ageRange` / `Product.material` fields)
- [x] PDP Description / Shipping / Jewellery Care tabs
- [x] Contact: topic dropdown, 0/500 character counter, WhatsApp banner, Showroom card, FAQ accordion
- [x] About full restyle: dark editorial hero, Vision narrative, Our Values 4-card grid, gold "Be Part of the Story" CTA band
- [x] Checkout sticky Order Summary; shipping fee wired to `adminSettings.shipping` per emirate
- [x] Account Overview tab (4 stat tiles + recent orders + quick actions); tab order is now Overview · Orders · Memories · Addresses · Wishlist
- [x] New `/my-memories` route — reads real memories from `data.store`, renders gold QR PNG per card with masked PIN

### Still pending (next steps)
